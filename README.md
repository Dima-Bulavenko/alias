# Project name


Alias is an online browser game that revolves around teams, each comprising two or more members. In this game, one team member is assigned the task of explaining a given word using alternative words to their fellow team members.

The objective of this project is to create a dynamic front-end website that adapts to user interactions, modifying the presentation of information to fulfill the user's objectives.

# Design

The site's design draws inspiration from the mobile application of the game "[play.google.com](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greylab.alias&hl=en_US&pli=1)". I've modified the structure of certain elements, completely overhauled the color scheme, and crafted an appearance specifically optimized for laptop screens.
